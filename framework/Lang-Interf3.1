Major changes to lang-interf between 3.0 and 3.1:

An interface has been added to allow use of our induction variable
recognition code.  See include/ivr-lang-interf.h.

More documentation has been added to make writing your own affine.c
clearer.  See src/affine.c.

Several changes were made to the names used in the language interface,
to bring them more in line with ivr-lang-interf and normal C
conventions.  An include file has been provided for compatibility with
the old names.
