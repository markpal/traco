doc.ms is a 'troff -ms' file that describes how to use the Tiny tool.
This file is also included in the tar file.  It is about 50 pages long.

tiny.list is the 'tar cvf' listing of the files in the tar file.

tiny.tar is a tape archive (tar) file containing the source files
to tiny.  It contains the following files:
	doc/doc		document, as above
	test/*		random 'tiny language' test source files
	source/makefile	self-explanatory
	source/*.c	C source for tiny
	source/*.h	header files
	source/*.l	'lex' file for front end
	source/*.y	'yacc' file for front end
	source/changec.csh	script for changing Tiny from
			ANSI C to K&R C function headers, for those
			without access to a newer compiler.

Unpack tiny.tar with the command 'tar xvpf tiny.tar' in the directory
where you want these files created.
