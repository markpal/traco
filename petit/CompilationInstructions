			    COMPILING PETIT
			    --------------



To compile petit 0.97, you will need the following:

 * A C++ compiler
 * make
 * The Omega Library version 0.97

Recommended but not absolutely required:
 * X11 and the Motif widget library (see below)

Edit the file obj/Makefile, following the instructions there.  Then,
make petit.

Petit is written in C++, and has been compiled with GNU G++ versions
2.5.8 and 2.6.3.  Version 2.6.3 is recommended, since its handling of
templates produces smaller object files and executables.  Some attempt
has been made to get Petit to compile under SunPro CC version 3.0.1,
but it does not support the C++ features that Petit needs.  It may be
possible to compile Petit with other commercial C++ compilers; petit
does not depend on any features of the GNU libg++. 

Petit requires flex and bison rather than lex and yacc.  The output from
flex and bison is included, so you should be able to compile without
them unless you make changes to the petit grammar.

Petit requires X11 and Motif to compile the interactive version.  A
batch-only petit can be built.  See the Makefile for details.  Use the
flag -DBATCH_ONLY_PETIT=1 in the PETIT_FLAGS makefile variable.  A
petit built in this way will only work with the -R option (see
petit.ps for details.)

Please let us know of any difficulty you encounter in building Petit
so that we can correct the problems in future releases.
