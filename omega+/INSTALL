BUILD
=====

1. Edit Makefile.config.  There have a few things to edit, such as
   location of system-specific files, and options for different
   operating systems. If you don't want SUIF support, simply set
   BUILD_SUIF as false.

2. Do "make depend" in the omega directory.

3. Optional, do "make clean" or "make veryclean" which removes additional
   target files.

4. Choose a target, and make it, or simply do "make".
   Targets are: libomega.a, libcode_gen.a and oc.

   You can also change to the target's obj/ subdirectory, for example
   omega/omega_calc/obj/, and do a "make" there.


INSTALLATION
============

You can use the Omega Library Plus in source directory since all links
are already created in bin/, lib/ and include/ directories. If you
want to install the library in a public directory, you need to set a
DESTDIR in Makefile.config.  The files will be installed as:

DESTDIR/    Installation root      
  lib/      All library files go here (libomega.a, libcode_gen.a)
  include/  
    omega.h         Main omega include file.
    omega/          Lbrary includes.
    basic/          Basic includes.
    code_gen/       Code generator includes.
  bin/      Binaries (oc)

You can change the relative layout of these files by editing the other
destination variables in Makefile.config.
